TCAP offered MSI faculty potential areas of collaboration that provide opportunities to train students and to participate in research.  Fayetteville State University is one of eight MSI participant universities in the MSI/TCAP partnership.  TCAP funding allowed FSU students to participate in TCAP-related summer internship programs, work on projects in wheat and barley breeding and genetics labs, and attend the 2014 TCAP Undergraduate Research Academy.</p>
