			<p>Economic Development Administration grant award 04-06-06979 funding supports an animal waste management feasibility study that will advise regional stakeholders of potential new market opportunities for hog waste that can result in a significant value-add to the farming/food production sector. North Carolina is the second leading hog farming state in the country, with almost 2,000 hog farms and 9 million hogs. Over 50% of these hogs are concentrated in the target region of this study. This project will help advance new, innovative ideas on how a current regional by-product from the agriculture cluster could be capitalized to foster greater business and job opportunities for people of the region.</p>
