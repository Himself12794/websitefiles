			<p>U.S. Army grant award W911NF-11-1-0178 provides funding for applying genomic techniques to investigate the genetic analysis of several important agronomic traits, and identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed isoflavones content, protein and oil content, yield, and yield components on the soybean genome.  Funding will also support research and training of undergrad and graduate students knowledge of several genomic techniques, using state-of-the art equipment, analyzing data using statistical genomic software, and be trained in scientific writing of abstracts and publications. </p>

			<p>The University of Minnesota received an award from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA to develop new varieties of wheat and barley under the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TCAP).  TCAP offered MSI faculty potential areas of collaboration that provide opportunities to train students and to participate in research.  Fayetteville State University is one of eight MSI participant universities in the MSI/TCAP partnership.  TCAP funding allowed FSU students to participate in TCAP-related summer internship programs, work on projects in wheat and barley breeding and genetics labs, and attend the 2014 TCAP Undergraduate Research Academy.</p>
